# ShaderGenerator
ShaderGenerator is an application that can work as a framework for tile-based games. It has a built in shader-renderer, and can display multiple scenes at once. It also supports the addition of custom scenes, should that be necessary. As well as this, its in built shader-renderer is also able to render with true aspect-ratios, so that your pixellated images does not become a mush.
